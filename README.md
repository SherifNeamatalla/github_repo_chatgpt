This project basically builds this
repo https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/code/twitter-the-algorithm-analysis-deeplake.html.

Built on Langchain "ConversationalRetrievalChain", this can take a github repo url and do the following:

1. Clone the repo
2. Load the files into python code
3. Split the files into chunks
4. Index the chunks in DeepLake
5. Start chain
6. Ask a question

To use this you need:
1.OpenAI API key
2.DeepLake API key "https://docs.activeloop.ai/quickstart"

#The following was generated by feeding this repo url to the agent (decided not to edit it!) and asking it to summarize
the repo as if it was
writing it for a README.md file.

To use the system, the user inputs the URL of the Github repository they want to query. The system then clones the
repository to a local directory and indexes its contents using DeepLake, a vector store that uses OpenAI embeddings. The
indexed contents are split into chunks of text using the CharacterTextSplitter, and each chunk is treated as a separate
document for retrieval purposes.

Once the repository is indexed, the system waits for user input in the form of a question related to the repository. The
system uses the user's input to retrieve the most relevant document from the repository and generate a response using
the GPT-3 model. The response is then displayed to the user, along with a prompt for further questions.

The purpose of this project is to provide a conversational interface for interacting with Github repositories. This can
be useful for developers who want to quickly find information or code snippets within a repository without having to
manually search through its contents.
